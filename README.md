Trying to make a virus scanner PYTHON

This is my first time using Python 3.2
I am trying to make a virus scanner.

The idea is to scan files and folders in a directory 
and generate an md5 hash and cross reference it to a 
list of md5 hash's that can come from a database such as ClamAV

The program will then return files that have a matching md5 to the database
and from there you can remove the files.
